Helioviewer Beta lives at <https://beta.helioviewer.org>


Help us improve Helioviewer by trying out our [Beta Site](https://beta.helioviewer.org).
As we continue development of helioviewer, all the latest features and bug fixes
will be posted to Beta as a staging area for us all to test and try out. It will
be updated with nightly releases, so there is potential for some instability.

A few things of things to note about this ongoing beta release:

1. Beta only hosts the latest 31 days of solar data.

2. API Users can access the Beta API at <https://api.beta.helioviewer.org>

3. JPIP Sever users can access this resource at <jpip://beta.helioviewer.org:8090>

4. You can see what's new on Beta by clicking on the beta label:
